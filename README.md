### Student Learning Outcomes:

**CSLO1** - Analyze problems and provide logical solutions to them.

**CSLO2** - Outline solutions in a systematic fashion, such as flowcharting or pseudo-code.

**CSLO3** - Use classes, methods, and objects to implement Java programs, including creation and coding of child classes and instances.

**CSLO4** - Designate and identify sequential, selection, and iteration control structure.

### Mid-Term Exam

The mid-term exam will be held in the usual class room, ECC-20, from 5:00PM to 7:05PM on Wednesday, March 11, 2020. 

### Final Exam

The final exam will be held in the usual class room, ECC-20, from 5:00PM to 7:05PM on Wednesday, May 6, 2020. 

Remember, the following Monday, May 4, 2020, there is no class or lecture.

### Examination Materials

For all exams, both the mid-term and final, you will need to bring:

1. A writing utensil (No. 2 Pencil) 
1. An 8.5" X 11" sheet of paper with your notes (you can put notes on both sides), 
1. A Scantron 882-E form and that's it. 

There will be no need for a calculator. As a matter of fact, if you think you  need a calculator, you're probably doing 
something wrong.

### Grading:

Grades for the current semester are available on Canvas. At the end of the semester, the total number of points awarded is added up and grades are given on the basis of the percentage of that total. The grade basis is:

#### Grade
Minimum Percentage

| Grade|     | Percent |
|-----:|:---:|--------:|
| A+   |  ≥  |    100% |
| A    |  ≥  |     91% |
| A-   |  ≥  |     88% |
| B+   |  ≥  |     85% |
| B    |  ≥  |     81% |
| B-   |  ≥  |     78% |
| C+   |  ≥  |     75% |
| C    |  ≥  |     69% |
| D    |  ≥  |     59% |
| F    |  <  |     59% |


#### Grade Breakdown

Your grade is based on how you do on programming assignments, participation, and the mid-term & final examinations. Each of these items are weighted when calculating your final grade. The following table gives these weights:

|Type                             |Weight|
|:--------------------------------|-----:|
| Participation                   |  10% |
| Quizzes                         |  10% |
| Programming Assignments         |  30% |
| Mid-term Examination            |  20% |
| Final Examination               |  30% |
|**Total**                        | **100%** | 

#### Notes:

- I use 91% rather than 92% so I can give a higher grade to those students who are close. This means that if you are at 90.99% you are not close to an "A".

- This class is exam, quiz, and programming assignment oriented. You must successfully complete all of the exams, quizzes and programming assignments in order to get the maximum out of this class.

- Programming assignments are turned in when they are submitted using GitHub. No credit will be given for any other method of submission unless explicitly requested to do so.

- Assignments with due dates on the Sunday following the last day of instruction cannot be turned in late.

The midterm and the final exam will be given on the dates announced on the web pages.
Quizzes have a an hour time limit and are for the express purpose of making sure that you are keeping up on your reading. Quizzes can be taken twice (with a half an hour between attempts) but are due on the time and date specified and cannot be completed late.

#### Late Assignments:

To get the most out of the class all assignments should be turned in before the time shown for each individual assignment. Do not make assumptions about when items are due! However, some items are accepted late using the procedure detailed below.

Programming Assignments  
- Can be turned in late.

Quizzes  
- **Cannot** be completed late.

Midterm  
- **Cannot** be turned in late, unless prior arrangements are made at least 1 week in advance.

Final  
- **Cannot** be turned in late, unless prior arrangements are made at least 2 weeks in advance.

#### Procedure for late assignments

Each assignment has a point value, for example, 6 points. Students may turn in assignments late and have deducted one point for each 24 hour period the assignment is turned in after the due date (all times for due dates are Pacific Time). For example, the 6 point assignment turned in one second (or any measurable fraction of time) after the due date and time will have one point deducted from it. As each 24 hour period expires, another point will be deducted. As soon as the point value is zero, the assignment can no longer be turned in. That means the 6 point assignment cannot be turned in after six 24 hour periods has passed. This concept is very important when applying extra credit. 

For the purposes of deciding when an assignment is completed, I will take the time of the commit in GitHub, not when the tests are run on the Jenkins CI server.

For those assignments that are turned in late but before the final cut off, you can apply extra credit points you earn through out the term to make up for these lost points. Again, see the section on Extra Credit for further details.

Please read carefully the next section, regarding Extra Credit, for further details.

#### Extra Credit

To allow students to be as successful as possible, there will be several opportunities to earn extra credit throughout the term. These points can then be applied to lost credit on assignments (whether late or not), and then to exams, in that order. No extra credit points will be applied to participation.

The following descriptions detail the different types of extra credit that will be given throughout the term.

1. _Extra Credit Assignments_: I will post near the beginning of the quarter at least two extra credit assignments where students can earn up to 5 points for each assignment by writing about specific historical events in computing. These events will be chosen by me, and posted to the Moodle site. Their due date will be at the end of the term.

3. _Make Allan Cooler_: On Slack there is a channel specifically named "Make Allan Cooler" participation in this channel with colloquilisms and contempory song suggestions will earn students extra credit points, determined at the end of the term.

3. _SBCC CS Club Events_: Throughout the term the CS Club will be putting on talks from people in industry and academia. You can earn extra credit points for attending these events. Students must sign the attendance sheet at the talk to earn the extra credit points. I will post on the Moodle site which events qualify for extra credit.

### Accommodations

SBCC students with verified disabilities who are requesting academic accommodations should use the following procedure:

**Step 1:** Obtain documentation of your disability from a licensed professional. You may use the “Disability Verification Form” found at [www.sbcc.edu/dsps](http://www.sbcc.edu/dsps).

**Step 2:** Make an appointment to meet with a DSPS Specialist to review your documentation and **discuss reasonable accommodations. To schedule a meeting, please call DSPS at (805) 730-4164.

**Step 3:** Bring your disability documentation to your DSPS appointment. The DSPS office is located in room 160 of the Student Services building.

**Step 4:** Each semester, reach written accommodation agreement with the DSPS Specialist and your instructor.

Please complete this process in a timely manner to allow adequate time to provide accommodation.
